# Real World Challenges

Welcome to **Real World Challenges**! This repository is designed to help you practice and showcase your skills by solving real-world scenarios in various technologies such as TypeScript, Node.js, React, Next.js, and more.

## How It Works

1. **Scenarios by Technology:**

   - Each technology has its own folder (e.g., `typescript`, `node`, `react`, `next`).
   - Each challenge is a markdown file named after the scenario (e.g., `type-safe-feature-toggle-handler.md`).

2. **Solving a Challenge:**
   - Read the scenario/question in the relevant tech folder.
   - Solve the challenge in an external environment (e.g., [CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/)).
   - Fork this repository.
   - Add your answer link under the `## Answers` section in the challenge file, using the format below.
   - Create a Pull Request (PR) to submit your answer.

## Answer Format

Please paste your answer in the following format under the `## Answers` section of the challenge file:

```
[@your_github_username](your-solution-link)
```

**Example:**

```
[@hassan_zohdy](https://codesandbox.io/)
```

## How to Add a New Challenge

1. Create a new markdown file in the relevant tech folder (e.g., `typescript/your-challenge-name.md`).
2. Add the scenario/question details.
3. Include a `## Answers` section at the end of the file.
